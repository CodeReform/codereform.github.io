## Hey it's me
I am George Dyrrachitis, a passionate Software Engineer, passionate anime fan, serial memer and adventurous individual. I love coding and sharing knowledge with other people, thus this blog.

In this blog I note down my ideas on different topics of computer science, so please don't expect a strict format, I blog pretty much about anything, soft skills, technical, design, or any other idea I have in my mind!

I currently live and work as a Senior Software Engineer in Dublin, enjoying being involved in various technology meetups and events.
